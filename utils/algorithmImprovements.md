# Vroom Algorithm: Future Improvements

## Current State
The current algorithm uses rule-based scoring with weighted factors:
- 40% Relevance (social connections, content similarity)
- 30% Engagement (likes, comments, completion rate)
- 20% Freshness (recency with viral boost)
- 10% Diversity (author variety)

## Machine Learning Enhancements

### 1. User Embedding Models
**Goal**: Create dense vector representations of users and content

**Implementation**:
- Train embeddings on user interaction patterns
- Use techniques like Word2Vec/Doc2Vec on user behavior sequences
- Cluster users with similar interests for collaborative filtering
- Tools: TensorFlow.js, PyTorch (via API), or Supabase Edge Functions

**Data Required**:
- User interaction sequences (like, skip, watch_time, share)
- Content features (hashtags, audio, visual analysis)
- Social graph connections

### 2. Content Understanding
**Goal**: Automatically extract content features from videos

**Techniques**:
- **Audio Analysis**: Extract music genre, engine sounds, speech sentiment
- **Visual Analysis**: Detect car brands, modifications, scenes (track, street, garage)
- **Text Processing**: Analyze captions for topics, sentiment, intent

**Integration**: 
- Store extracted features in `content_features` table
- Use for similarity matching and topic-based recommendations

### 3. Real-time Learning
**Goal**: Adapt algorithm weights based on user response

**Approach**:
- A/B test different weight combinations
- Use multi-armed bandit algorithms to optimize weights per user segment
- Implement online learning to adjust based on immediate feedback

**Metrics to Track**:
- Session duration
- Like rate per session
- Skip rate
- Return visit frequency

### 4. Collaborative Filtering
**Goal**: "Users like you also enjoyed..." recommendations

**Methods**:
- **User-User CF**: Find similar users, recommend their liked content
- **Item-Item CF**: "If you liked this car video, you'll like this one"
- **Matrix Factorization**: SVD/NMF on user-item interaction matrix

**Database Schema Addition**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_similarities (
  user_id_1 UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  user_id_2 UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  similarity_score DECIMAL(5,4),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 5. Advanced Engagement Prediction
**Goal**: Predict likelihood of engagement before showing content

**Features**:
- Time of day user is most active
- Device type and connection speed
- Recent interaction patterns
- Social context (friends online, trending topics)

**Model**: Gradient boosting (XGBoost) or neural networks

### 6. Temporal Dynamics
**Goal**: Account for changing interests over time

**Techniques**:
- Exponential decay on older interactions
- Seasonal/weekly pattern detection
- Interest drift modeling
- Trend detection and amplification

### 7. Multi-Objective Optimization
**Goal**: Balance multiple competing objectives

**Objectives**:
- User engagement (primary)
- Content diversity
- Creator monetization fairness
- Platform health (reduce harmful content)

**Method**: Pareto optimization or scalarization with dynamic weights

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Immediate - 2 weeks)
- [ ] Enhanced view tracking with video duration
- [ ] Basic collaborative filtering using existing interaction data
- [ ] A/B testing framework for algorithm weights

### Phase 2 (1-2 months)

## Success Metrics
1. **User Engagement**: Session duration, videos per session, like rate
2. **Content Discovery**: Diversity score, new creator exposure
3. **Creator Satisfaction**: Fair distribution, growth opportunities
4. **Business**: Ad engagement, user retention, DAU/MAU
